## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Shreyash Kakde

ðŸŽ“ Master's in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) @ USC  
ðŸ’¡ Passionate about building real-world AI systems that blend reasoning, language, and learning.

---

ðŸ”¬ **Recent Project:**  
ðŸ©º **Biomedical Literature Q&A System using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
Fine-tuned **Mistral-7B** using **QLoRA** and integrated it into a lightweight RAG pipeline for medical Q&A. Evaluated on clinical and domain-specific datasets (e.g., breast cancer), achieving strong BERTScore results with FAISS-based retrieval.

ðŸš€ **Currently working on:**  
Building **Agentic RAG systems** by integrating the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for more adaptive reasoning and dynamic memory management in long-context medical assistants.

ðŸŒ± **Currently learning:**  
Advanced **MCP architectures**, reinforcement learning for agents, and efficient **LLM fine-tuning techniques** (QLoRA, PEFT).

ðŸ‘¯ **Looking to collaborate on:**  
AI research and projects in **NLP**, **LLMs**, and **Medical AI**â€”especially involving intelligent assistants, information retrieval, and domain-specific fine-tuning.

ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about:**  
Natural Language Processing, biomedical Q&A systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, LLM optimization, and Python workflows.

âš¡ **Fun fact:** I built a dermatology tool that generates scalp health reports in 5 minutesâ€”validated by real doctors, powered by AI.
